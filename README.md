# DiceRollSimulator
The user enters an amount of times they would like the simulated dice to be rolled, and in return receives a histogram
detailing how many times each numbed came up in terms of percentage of total rolls.
Each asterisk represents one percent of the total rolls (specified by the user), so if the dice are rolled one thousand
times and there are two asterisks next to the number 2, that means thaat there were twenty rolls totalling to the number two.
Demonstrated in this class is working knowledge of building and calling methods auxiliary to the main() method, use of the
Java.util.Random utility, and working knowledge of arrays.
